<!--- This Section covers the settings which always apply -->	
	<ShowOnlyOnDeath>True</ShowOnlyOnDeath> <!-- IMPORTANT SETTING: If you set this to True the Companion will only spawn on your death, if you set it to False it will spawn at the start of the battle -->
	<SpeedAroundAxis>4.0</SpeedAroundAxis> <!--- The Speed in which the Companion Rotates around itself (set to 0 if you don't want any Rotation)-->

	<!--- This Section covers Rotation around the Tank in a Circle-->
	<RotateAroundTank>True</RotateAroundTank><!--- Set to True/False if the companion should rotate around the tank. If you set this to off it will try to reach the center above the tank (will disable Radius and SpeedCircle) -->
